# KDAG Task Round 🚀  

This repository contains solutions for the **KDAG selection task round**, which includes:  

- **Task 1:** A simulation built using **Pygame**  
- **Task 2:** A data analytics project on **music genre analysis** in **Jupyter Notebook**  

## 📌 Tasks Overview  

### 🎮 Task 1: Pygame Simulation  
- Developed a **custom simulation/game** using **Pygame**.  
- The details and requirements are outlined in **[TASK_1.pdf](./TASK_1.pdf)**.  

### 🎵 Task 2: Music Genre Analysis  
- Implemented **text-based music analysis** using **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.  
- The dataset consists of songs described by three keywords.  
- The goal was to **vectorize keywords, reduce dimensionality, cluster similar songs, and analyze results**.  
- Refer to **[TASK_2.pdf](./TASK_2.pdf)** and **[TASK_2_REPORT.pdf](./TASK_2_REPORT.pdf)** for a detailed breakdown.  

## 🚀 How to Run  

### Task 1: Pygame Simulation  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
2. Run the simulation script:
   ```bash
   TASK 1.py
### Task 2: Music Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
2. Open Jupyter Notebook and run
   ```bash
   TASK 2.ipynb

## Possible Improvements
Task 1: Adding more interactive features to the simulation

Task 2: Exploring alternative clustering techniques like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering
